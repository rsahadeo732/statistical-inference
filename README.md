# statistical-inference

This repository contains selected work from **STAT 291: Statistical Inference for Data Science** at Rutgers University.

All analyses were completed in **R** using **R Markdown** and rendered to HTML. The labs focus on core ideas in statistical inference and how to implement them in code.

## Contents

**sampling-regression**  
Introduces basic sampling and simple linear regression.  
Draws samples from a population, computes sample summaries, and fits a first regression model.

**sampling-distributions**  
Explores sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.  
Uses simulation to show how sample means behave across repeated samples.

**bootstrap-ci**  
Covers bootstrap methods for confidence intervals.  
Implements resampling-based CIs for means and proportions and compares them to theoretical intervals.

**hypothesis-tests**  
Applies classical hypothesis testing in R.  
Formulates null and alternative hypotheses, computes test statistics and p-values, and interprets results in context.

**galton-peas-regression**  
Small regression case study using Galton’s peas data.  
Fits a linear model and examines the relationship between parent and offspring measurements.

## Skills demonstrated

- Programming and data analysis in **R**
- Working with **R Markdown** to combine code, output, and narrative
- Understanding of sampling, CLT, and sampling distributions
- Construction and interpretation of **confidence intervals**
